We use the L<Log::Any> framework for logging events.
You may tell where it should log using any available L<Log::Any::Adapter> module.

For example, to log everything to a file you just have to add a line to your script, like this:
    #! /usr/bin/env perl
    use Log::Any::Adapter (File => '/var/log/payment.log');
    use {{$current}};

You must import C<Log::Any::Adapter> before our libraries, to initialize the logger instance before use.

You can choose your log level on import directly:
    use Log::Any::Adapter (File => '/var/log/payment.log', log_level => 'info');

Read the L<Log::Any> documentation to know what other options you have.
